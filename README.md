# News Front-End

## Project Summary 

This project interprets a real-world Front End service, such as Reddit, that connects to the API I created during my Back End project. `The Everyday Journalist` is a React-based front end that serves articles, optionally filtered by topics, posts and deletes comments, up and down-votes, and allows the sorting of the articles.
